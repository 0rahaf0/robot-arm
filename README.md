# description of the desine components:
Base Rotation (1st DOF):
A stepper motor located at the base enables a full 360-degree rotation, allowing for extensive coverage of the surrounding area.

Shoulder Joint (2nd DOF):
A servo motor positioned above the base provides 180-degree vertical movement, enabling the arm to move up and down.

Elbow Joint (3rd DOF):
A revolute joint offers 180-degree vertical articulation, adding further flexibility to the arm's movements.

Wrist Rotation (4th DOF):
Another servo motor allows for 180-degree lateral (side-to-side) rotation, enhancing the arm's ability to position the end effector.

End Effector Control (5th DOF):
A revolute joint at the end of the arm governs the gripper, providing 180-degree lateral control for precise manipulation tasks.
